    <p>Contract
        I, <i>Alekzandr P. Cox</i> agree to abide by the terms o
        f the course contract in my Spring 2024,
         ITIS3135, Web Application and Design with my instructor
         , Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand t
         hat all work that I do on publicly available 
         online tools will be available to the world, a
         nd will not put information there that is inap
         propriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep
          private. I also understand that it is my work t
          hat counts for attendance, not logins or showin
          g up for class. As such, failure to turn in ass
          ignments may show as absences. I also understa
          nd that given the structure and content of 
          this class it’s possible to find many examples 
          online or even view my classmates’ code di
          rectly. I swear that I will only use these 
          resources to learn, and will not cut and pas
          te code except where I have properly given 
          credit (i.e. external libraries) and never 
          from my classmates. Signed: <i>Alekzandr P. Cox</i> , 04/27/2004</p>
